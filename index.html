  <h1>React</h1>

  <p><strong>React</strong> is a Jacascript library and is used for building interactive user interface (UI) components. React was developed by Jordan Walke a software engineer at Facebook and is a open-source code. It can be used both as a base in web development but also in mobile applications. With react it's easy to interface with other libraries and frameworks using external plugins. React has a couple of notable features, such as One-way data bindings with props, Stateful components and the use of virtual DOM (Document Object Model).</p>
